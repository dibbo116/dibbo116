I am a hardworking and ambitious person with a great passion for the software development industry. I am currently in my 4th year of the CSE department at RUET. As a class representative of my class for about two years, I developed my leadership and management skills. Being engaged in some voluntary organizations, I also developed my communication and organizational skills. I want to see myself as a software engineer where I wish to learn new things, face new challenges, and want to improve my skills.
